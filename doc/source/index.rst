Welcome to burrahobbit's documentation!
=======================================
Burrahobbit is a project offering the developer persistent (immutable) data
containers that allow for cheap copies and similar time complexity to the
builtin data-structures, e.g. dictionaries and sets have O(log32 n) access
complexity.

It is heavily influenced by the persistent datastructures found in the Clojure
programming language. New datastructures will be added in following releases,
0.1 will only provide sets and dicts.
